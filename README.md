# Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder

[Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder](https://hyperskill.org/projects/293) provides the necessary tools to work with string and character variables, as well as loops and conditional statements. It also introduces binary notation and data type conversion, and allows users to create an application for unary representation and decoding of any text.

Explore this [Chuck Norris Cipher Converter](https://www.dcode.fr/chuck-norris-code) website for further details, and try the converter yourself.
